    <p>
      This Privacy Policy and Disclaimer (“Policy”) governs the manner in which this application (“App,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, stores, discloses, and protects personal information provided by its users (“you” or “your”), as well as the terms under which the App is made available. By accessing or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree, you must immediately discontinue use.

    <p>
      We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users and complying with applicable data protection regulations. Information we collect may include, without limitation, identifiers such as your name, email address, or other contact details voluntarily provided by you; technical and usage data such as device information, IP address, browser type, or interaction patterns within the App; and any content or preferences you choose to share in connection with your use of the App. We may collect such data directly from you, automatically through your use of the App, or from third-party service providers with whom we partner.

    <p>
      The information we collect is used strictly for purposes that include but are not limited to: enabling the functionality of the App, maintaining the security and integrity of our services, analyzing usage patterns to improve user experience, fulfilling legal obligations, and communicating with you regarding updates, features, or policy changes. We may also employ aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified data for research, analytical, or commercial purposes. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to unaffiliated third parties. However, we may disclose information to trusted service providers who perform functions on our behalf, to comply with legal obligations or lawful requests, to protect the rights, property, or safety of the App, its users, or the public, or in connection with corporate restructuring events such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
    </p>

    <p>
      We implement commercially reasonable measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Notwithstanding these efforts, no system of data storage or transmission can be guaranteed to be fully secure. By using the App, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any credentials or access methods associated with your use of the App.

      To the fullest extent permitted by law, the App and all related services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We make no representations or guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of the information or functionalities provided. Use of the App is undertaken at your sole risk. Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with your use of, or inability to use, the App, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Nothing in this Policy shall exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.
